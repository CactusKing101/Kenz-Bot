You can make +5ðŸ¦´ points per minute of messaging. This use's a cooldown system that starts a 1 minute cooldown on point gain.\n2. Spending 1 minute in vc will give you +2ðŸ¦´ points. If you are not muted you will instead get a total of +5ðŸ¦´ points. If you are not muted and use camera you will get a total +8ðŸ¦´ points. If you can not use your camera you can instead screenshare while unmuted to get a total of +6ðŸ¦´ points.\n3. also events may give points :D\n\n**If you put https://discord.gg/Hja2gSnsAu in your status you will get about 1.5x as many points**`, '#ffffba');
